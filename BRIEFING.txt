PROJECT 001

USE OF EXCEL TO ANALYSE AND CREATE A VISUALISATION DASHBOARD TO REPRESENT DATA FROM VIKKY'S COFFEE SHOP
STEPS TAKEN TO ACHIEVE THIS;

1.COLLECTION OF DATA
DATA WAS COLLECTED IN FORM OF EXCEL FILES WHICH WAS THEN DUPLICATED FOR FURTHER WORK

2.CLEANING OF DATA
THE DATA TO BE WORKED ON WAS CLEANED BY :
*REMOVING DUPLICATES
*CHECKING FOR MISSING VALUES(BLANKS) AND DELETING OR FILLING THEM AS NECESSARY
* CHECKING FOR SPELLING ERRORS

3. DATA EXPLORATION
THE CLEANED DATA WAS SET FOR EXPLORATION SO I DID THE FOLLOWING
*OUTLNED MY OBJECTIVES IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH WAS TO IDENTIFY THE TREND FLOW OF THE REVENUE AND CROSSING THEM WITH
 POSSIBLE CAUSING FACTORS
*CHECKED FOR THE AVAILABLE COLUMN I WOULD BE WORKING ON
*ADDED COLUMNS I WOULD NEED LIKE THE REVENUE COLUMN,MONTH COLUMN, DAYS COLUMN AND HOUR COLUMN
*CHECKED FOR THE COLUMNS I WOULD NOT NEED WHICH I COULD DELETE OR IGNORE

4 DATA VISUALISATION
AFTER EXPLORING THE DATA I STARTED PLOTING FACTORS USING THE PIVOT CHART
*PLOTED REVENUE AGAINST MONTHS TO VISUALISE THE MONTHS WITH EACH REVENUES GENERATED
*PLOTED TRANSACTION QUANTITY AGAINST DAYS AND HOURS TO IDENTIFY THE MOST PROACTVE PERIODS
*PLOTTED TRANSACTION QUANTITY AGAINST THE DIFFERENT PRODUCT CATEGORIES TO IDENTIFY THE MOST SELLING PRODUCTS AT
 TIME
*FINALLY, I ADDED MONTHLY SLICERS FOR FUTURE PURPOSES WHEN SALES DATA ACCUMULATES TO YEARLY VALUES SO MONTHS
 CAN BE COMPARED
 THEREAFTER, I CREATED A DASHBOARD TO REPRESENT MY FINDING AND TO EASILY RELAY THE INFORMATION WITH THE TEAM

5 DATA PROJECTION
 AFTER THE THOROUGH ANALYSIS HERE ARE MY PROJECTIONS FRO VIKKY'S COFFEE SHOP
